                    I have been working full time as an Account Manager for the last 5 years. I have 2 
                    girls, ages 5 and 3 with a boy on the way in April 2020. My career has gotten stale
                    and I looked for a new job for several months but could never find the right fit.
                    I have a little experience in coding and always thought that one day I would learn it.
                    In college I took a visual media course and really enjoyed it. So I put these two
                    areas together and it led me to this coding bootcamp course. I am combining my creative
                    side with coding to get a job in software development to have a fulfilling career.
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time I am a big sports fan. I follow the Portland Trail Blazers and Oregon Ducks 
                    football and basketball programs. If you ask my wife of 11 years about my sports fandem, she will
                    roll her eyes. She is not a sports fan. Let's just say I am excited to finally
                    have a boy join the family so I can have a buddy to watch with me.
